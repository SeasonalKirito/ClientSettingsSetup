# Python Manager Class for Roblox

This Python script contains a `Manager` class that provides several functionalities related to the Roblox game client. It is designed to interact with the Roblox game client on a system level, providing features such as finding the Roblox process, closing the Roblox process, and checking client settings.

## Features

1. **Get Current Time**: The `_get_time` method returns the current system time in the format 'HH:MM:SS'.

2. **Loading Animation**: The `_loading_animation` method displays a loading animation in the console. The animation pattern is defined by the `LOADING_PATTERNS` attribute.

3. **Find Roblox Process**: The `_find_roblox` method scans the system's active processes to find the Roblox game client process ("RobloxPlayerBeta.exe"). It also supports a loading animation during the search process.

4. **Close Roblox Process**: The `_close_roblox` method terminates the Roblox process. It takes a process ID as an argument.

5. **Check Client Settings**: The `_check_client_settings` method checks the client settings of the Roblox process. The specific checks performed by this method are not defined in the provided code excerpt.

## Usage

To use this script, create an instance of the `Manager` class and call its methods as needed. Note that some methods require specific arguments, such as a process ID or strings to display during the loading animation.

```python
manager = Manager()
roblox_process = manager._find_roblox()
manager._close_roblox(roblox_process)
```

## Dependencies

This script requires the `psutil` Python library to interact with system processes. Make sure to install this library using pip:

```bash
pip install psutil
```

## Disclaimer

This script interacts directly with system processes, which can potentially affect system stability. Use it responsibly and only if you understand what each method does.
